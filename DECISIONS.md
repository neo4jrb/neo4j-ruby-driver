# Decision Log

Chronological record of architectural choices. Newest entries at the
bottom. Keep entries short — the source is the source of truth for
code; this log captures the *why*.

## 2026-04-22 — `Session#run` parameters/config split

`def run(query, parameters = {}, config = {})` — explicit split rather than
merged kwargs. Lets the same key appear in both (e.g.
`session.run(q, { metadata: 'param' }, metadata: { config: true })`).
Mirrors `execute_read/write`, which take `timeout` and `metadata` explicitly.

## 2026-04-22 — Timeout units: seconds in API, milliseconds on the wire

User-facing API accepts seconds (or `ActiveSupport::Duration`). Conversion to
ms happens in `timeout_to_milliseconds` before sending over Bolt. Matches
Ruby's `sleep(60)` convention.

## 2026-04-22 — Bookmarks replaced, not accumulated

`session.last_bookmarks` returns a `Set` of 0 or 1. Each committed transaction
generates one bookmark that replaces the previous. Unsuccessful ops (rollback,
failure, auto-commit) don't update it. Matches Java driver.

## 2026-04-22 — `last_bookmarks` returns unfrozen Set

Dropped `.dup.freeze` from the accessor. No reason to special-case bookmarks
when no other returned object is protected this way. Trust the caller.

## 2026-04-22 — Zeitwerk one-class-per-file

Refactor to strict Zeitwerk conventions. Nested classes are allowed when
they're genuine implementation details (`Path::Segment`, `Summary::Query`).
Namespace modules are autovivified from directory names — no
`<namespace>.rb` stubs that just declare `module Foo; end`.

## 2026-04-23 — Default-rollback for explicit block `begin_transaction`

`session.begin_transaction { |tx| ... }` rolls back on clean block exit
unless the user calls `tx.commit`. Managed transactions
(`execute_read/write`) still auto-commit on success. Matches the Java
driver's try-with-resources semantics.

## 2026-04-23 — `Result` state: `@consumed` vs `@discarded`

Two distinct flags:

- `@consumed` — stream drained from the wire (natural end, success or failure).
- `@discarded` — records explicitly released (user called `.consume`, or the
  owning session was closed); subsequent access raises `ResultConsumedException`.

After iteration via each/map/to_a: `@consumed=true`, `@discarded=false` —
subsequent `to_a` returns empty, not raise. After explicit `.consume` or
session close: `@discarded=true` — access raises.

Separately added `Result#buffer` (not user-facing): the driver calls it
internally when reusing a connection for a new query, so the prior
result's records are pulled into memory and remain accessible through the
user's existing reference.

## 2026-04-23 — Connection pooling via `connection_pool` gem

Use `ConnectionPool::TimedStack` — the gem's lower-level primitive —
not the top-level `ConnectionPool#checkout`, which caches per-thread and
would let multiple Sessions in the same thread share a connection and
step on each other's server-side transaction state.

Requires Ruby ≥ 3.2 (the 3.0 release of `connection_pool` dropped earlier
Rubies), so `required_ruby_version` is bumped to `>= 3.2.0`.

## 2026-04-23 — DateTime LOCAL encoding for signatures 0x46 / 0x66

Neo4j encodes `epoch_seconds` as wall-clock time treated as if it were
UTC (not the true UTC instant). The driver applies the conversion at the
boundary:

- Pack: `epoch_seconds = value.to_i + value.utc_offset`.
- Hydrate 0x46: `Time.at(seconds - offset).getlocal(offset)`.
- Hydrate 0x66: `tz.tzinfo.local_to_utc(wall_clock)` so the zone's *actual*
  offset at that instant is applied. A fixed `2 * tz.utc_offset` formula
  only happens to work in summer.

TimeWithZone values with a non-offset-shaped zone name are packed as 0x66
(preserves zone through Cypher equality); everything else as 0x46.

## 2026-04-23 — All requires in the gem entry

Stdlib and gem `require`s all live in `lib/neo4j/driver.rb`. Scattered
requires make load order depend on which internal file Zeitwerk touches
first, and turn touching an internal class into an implicit load-time
side effect. `require` is already idempotent, so `unless defined?(X)`
guards are pointless.

## 2026-04-27 — Ruby 3.4+ minimum

Bumped `required_ruby_version` from `>= 3.2.0` to `>= 3.4.0` to use
the `it` implicit block parameter in pipeline-style code (e.g.
`timeout&.then { (it.to_f * 1000).round }`). CI workflows updated
to Ruby 3.4 in lockstep. Two version bumps in three days is fine
while we're pre-1.0; once the API stabilises we'll be more
conservative about minimum-Ruby moves.
